// Find common elements in three sorted arrays from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-common-elements-three-sorted-arrays/

/*
Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

Examples:

ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80}
ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100}
ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120}
Output: 20, 80

ar1[] = {1, 5, 5}
ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10}
ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: 5, 5
